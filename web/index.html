					Who is Surveilling Me?
				</h1>
				<p>
					This is a simple service that allows you to try find out if your internet routes are being surveilled. Yes, the frontpage is terrible, as I am not a web developer (death to HTML!), and used some shitty online thing to build it using Bootstrap as thats the done thing these days.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyway, using this service is simple. Grab the script from Github, and run the client as root. It will download our current database of "malicious" IP addresses which are running known-bad shit (Blue Coat systems, made by those shitweasels who like spying on people), Cisco boxes with lawful intercept enabled, etc. It will then run some traceroutes, and if any of the "hops" correspond with bad kit, you get alerted. Simples :)
				</p>
				<p>
					Better web page coming soon, when someone with a clue about web development slaps me a few times and writes one and I get around to writing a proper backend, this was written at <a href="https://www.brumhack.co.uk/">BrumHack</a> after giving up on writing a JSON API for it due to JSON being horrible web stuff...

                                        <b> For the love of god do not depend on this with your life. Its not 100% accurate, its not 100% aware, its just an academic exercise in some stuff.</b>

                                        If you want, feel free to toss us some bitcoins so we can get this thing hosted properly, get it all SSL'd up, and build our own scanning infrastructure in the future: 1G3o12R9ShFqMfxnaXCJL5YpNts29nuDyy

                                        The "evil ip list" is available as a CSV file, in theory updated every hour, at <a href="http://surveilling.me/stuff/evil_ips.csv">evil_ips.csv</a> for your own use. Its format is "evildevice,ipaddress". For example: "BlueCoat Proxy,127.0.0.1" :)
